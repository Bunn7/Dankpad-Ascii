# Dankpad-Ascii
Ascii art for neofetch
------------------------
This is really just for me to save, but I put it here incase someone needed it
this is half made my me, I kind of just moved around letters I got from
https://github.com/roadkell/ascii-logos
and made the D.
But if you want to use it, I even put the ${c1/2}'s for colors.
